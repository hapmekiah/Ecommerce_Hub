E-commerce Customer Data Exploratory Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project delves into an E-commerce customer dataset, uncovering valuable insights about customer behavior on the website. By analyzing data on website interactions, product purchases, page views, cart additions, browsing time, and customer credentials, we aim to:

Understand customer behavior patterns: Identify how customers navigate the website, what products they tend to view and purchase, and how long they engage with different products.
Discover key business performance issues: Uncover factors that might be hindering conversion rates, customer satisfaction, or overall sales.
Formulate data-driven recommendations: Gain insights to guide website optimization, product recommendations, marketing strategies, and personalized customer experiences.
Data Description

The dataset encompasses a rich set of customer interaction data, including (but not limited to):

Customer demographics: Age, gender, location, Items added to cart, product browsing time and total items aded to cart.
Website interaction data: Clickstream data, page views, time spent on product pages, items added/removed from cart, search queries used.
Purchase data: Order history, product categories purchased, order value, frequency of purchases, preferred payment methods.
Product information: Product descriptions, categories, pricing, ratings, and reviews.
Customer credentials: Account information 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following steps outline the primary stages of the EDA process:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset using appropriate libraries (e.g., Pandas in Python).
Handled missing values through imputation or removal based on data quality and analysis goals.
Addressed inconsistencies, outliers, and data format issues for accurate analysis.
Data Exploration and Visualization:

Described the data using summary statistics and descriptive visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) to understand data distribution and relationships between variables.
Employed data visualization techniques like scatter plots, heatmaps, and interactive dashboards to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior, purchase history, and website interaction.
Identified Business Insights:

Analyzed customer segmentation based on demographics, purchase behavior, and website interaction patterns.
Investigated factors influencing conversion rates, such as product categories, browsing time, search queries, and cart abandonment rates.
Explored customer lifetime value (CLTV) to identify high-value customer segments.
Correlated website interaction metrics like product page views and time spent with purchase behavior.
Expected Outcomes and Deliverables:

A comprehensive EDA report outlining key findings and insights.
Data visualizations that effectively communicate patterns and relationships.
Actionable recommendations for website optimization, product marketing, and customer targeting strategies.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming libraries/frameworks (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn in Python)
Data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for interactive dashboards (optional)
Contribution

This project contributes to the field of E-commerce analytics by demonstrating the power of EDA in extracting valuable customer insights from website behavior data. The results can be used to optimize website design, product recommendations, marketing campaigns, and customer experience, ultimately leading to improved business performance.
